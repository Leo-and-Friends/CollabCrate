# Contributing to CollabCrate

Thank you for considering contributing to CollabCrate! Your help is greatly appreciated. Please review the following guidelines to make the contribution process smooth and effective.

## 1. Introduction

CollabCrate is a centralized hub that collects and curates open-source opportunities in one place. Our mission is to make open-source more accessible, connect contributors to valuable projects, and empower people to gain real-world experience. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, your contributions are welcome!

## 2. Code of Conduct

Please note that all contributors are expected to adhere to our Code of Conduct to foster a welcoming and inclusive environment. [A link to the Code of Conduct will be provided soon.]

## 3. How Can I Contribute?

We welcome contributions of all kinds! Here are some ways you can help:

### Reporting Bugs
- Search existing issues before submitting a new one.
- Provide clear steps to reproduce the bug, expected behavior, and screenshots if possible.

### Suggesting Enhancements
- Open an issue with your idea and explain why it would be beneficial.
- Be clear about the problem it solves or the value it adds.

### Submitting Pull Requests
- Fork the repository and create your branch from `main` or the appropriate branch.
- Follow the project’s code style and guidelines.
- Reference related issues in your PR description.
- Ensure your code passes all tests and linters.

### Improving Documentation
- Help keep our documentation accurate and up-to-date.
- Suggest improvements or clarify confusing sections.
- Fix typos, formatting, or add new guides.

## 4. Development Workflow

### Branching Model
- Use feature branches for new features or fixes (e.g., `feature/your-feature`, `fix/your-bug`).
- To create a new branch:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b feature/your-feature
  ```
- Keep your branch up to date with `main` by rebasing or merging as needed:
  ```bash
  git fetch origin
  git rebase origin/main
  # or
  git merge origin/main
  ```

### Commit Messages
- Write clear, concise commit messages (e.g., `fix: correct typo in README`).
- Use conventional commit prefixes when possible: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, etc.

### Pull Request Process
- Ensure your branch is up to date with the target branch before opening a PR.
- Push your branch to your fork:
  ```bash
  git push origin feature/your-feature
  ```
- Fill out the PR template if available, describing your changes and referencing related issues.
- Add screenshots or demos if your change affects the UI.
- Run tests and linters before submitting your PR:
  ```bash
  npm test
  npm run lint
  ```

### Code Review
- Be open to feedback and make requested changes promptly.
- Review other contributors’ PRs if you can.

## 5. Style Guides

### Coding Standards
- Follow JavaScript/React best practices.
- Keep code modular and readable.
- Use descriptive variable and function names.

### Linting & Formatting
- Use ESLint and Prettier for consistent code style (run `npm run lint` and `npm run format` if available).
- Fix all linting errors before submitting a PR.

### Documentation Style
- Write clear, concise documentation for any new components or features.
- Use Markdown for documentation files.
